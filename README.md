### Project Description
Smart Electricity Assistant is a web application that helps users track their electricity usage, estimate bills, and identify high-consumption appliances. It provides options to scan the meter, enter readings manually, or monitor appliance-wise usage, helping reduce energy waste and manage electricity efficiently.

### The Problem statement
Many households struggle to monitor their electricity consumption, estimate monthly bills, and identify which appliances use the most power. The lack of an easy-to-use tool leads to higher energy costs and inefficient electricity usage. This project aims to provide a smart solution that tracks usage, calculates bills, and helps users reduce energy waste.

### The Solution
The Smart Electricity Assistant provides an interactive web application where users can scan their electricity meter, enter readings manually, or monitor appliance-wise consumption. It automatically calculates estimated bills, highlights high-energy-consuming appliances, and gives insights to reduce electricity wastage, helping users save money and energy efficiently.
